## React template

This repository now contains a minimal Vite + React template scaffold in the `src/` folder.

To run locally (macOS / zsh):

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If you'd like a different tooling (Create React App, Next.js, or custom setup), tell me and I can convert this scaffold.
